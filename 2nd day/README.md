## Datatypes of Features/Variables

1. Discrete data values

   - Values that are well defined.
   - All categorical values fit in this section, there are no values in between.
   - Specific data.
   - Has clear spaces between values.
   - The data is countable.
   - Example:

   | YrOfBirth | 2000 | 2001 | 20002 | 2003 | 2004 |
   | --------- | ---- | ---- | ----- | ---- | ---- |
   | Response  | 0    | 1    |       |      |      |
   | DeptId    | 10   | 20   | 30    | 40   | 50   |

2. Continuous data values
   - These values may refer to an unspecified number of possible measurements between two points.
   - The data falls in a constant sequence.
   - Measurable data.
